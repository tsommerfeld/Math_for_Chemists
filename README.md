# Math_for_Chemists
Jupyter notebooks for Mathematics for Chemists

This course was created because chemistry majors are confined to a 120 hour curriculum, but lack three mathematics classes: Multi-variable calculus, differential equations, and statistics.

This course tries to remediate this situation by providing topics from these three classes selected so as to be useful for chemistry majors, and most examples and applications are taken from chemistry.

* Single and multivariable calculus relevant for physical, analytical, and biochemistry.
  * Taylor expansions in one and more more dimensions.
  * Implicit derivatives.
  * Error propagation.
  * Newton-Raphson root finding.
  * Total derivative for thermodynamics.
* Statistics.
  * Essentially a fast introductory course with applications to realistic data.
* Differential equations. 
  * Separable first-order differential equations and kinetics of a single concentration.
  * Systems of first-order differential equations and their relation to mechanisms.
  * Euler's method, Euler's modified method, and a proper ode-solver.
