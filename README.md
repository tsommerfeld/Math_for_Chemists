# Math_for_Chemists
Jupyter notebooks for Mathematics for Chemists

This course was created because chemistry majors are confined to a 120 hour curriculum, but lack three mathematics classes: Calculaus III, differential equations, and statistics.

This course tries to remediate this situation by providing topics from these three classes selected to be useful for chemistry majors, and most examples and applications are taken from chemistry.

* Some multivariable calculus.
  * Applications error propagation and Newton root finding.
  * Total derivative for thermodynamics.
* Statistics.
  * Essentially a fast introductory course with realistic data.
* First-order differential equations and systems of first-order differential equations and their connection to kinetics and mechanism.
  * Euler's method, Euler's modified method, and a proper ode-solver.
