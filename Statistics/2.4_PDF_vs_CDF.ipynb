    "Okay, we have some variable, let's call it $X$. Capital $X$ indicates that $X$ is *random* in some sense, it may be data, but it may also be a stastic. Make sure you understand this distinction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between PMF and PDF has to do with random variables that can take only *discreet* values (PMF) as oposed to *continuous* values (PDF).\n",
    "* Discreet: A certain set of numbers, often counts. The number of cars in a parking lot at a certain time or the citizens in a town must be whole = discrete numbers. You cannot have 0.3 citizens.\n",
    "* Continuous: A variable measured on a continous scale: weight, height, ...\n",
    "\n",
    "First, *discrete* $X$: A PMF is the function that gives the probability that my  discrete random variable $X$ is exactly equal to some value. Say, $X$: Number of children of a US citizen, then PMF(1) = probability that a US citizen has one child.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note, the total probability must equal $1$. So if I sum the PMF over all possible values of $X$, I must get $1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, *continuous* $X$: A wee bit more tricky. Consider a huge population, say, the heights of everyone living in in the US, $330,000,000$ $X$ values. Strictly speaking all these $X$ values are different - you just have to measure enough significant figures. Therefore, all of the $330,000,000$ values have the same probability of $P=1/300,000,000$ and any other  value has probability $0$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, that is ***not*** what we want. We want a function that interpolates a histogram with many, but not too many bins, a function that has the same shape as a reasonably fine histogram, but is continuous. This function is the PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "One caveat: A PDF cannot represent probability - probability is not defined at any specific $X$ value. Instead it represents ***probability density***, which means a PDF must be integrated over a certain range to compute probability. If you look at a PDF, you do that automatically by-eye: You look at area of a hump or of a tail, not at the specific values at certain points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, note, the total probability must equal $1$. So if I integrate the PDF over all possible values of $X$, I must get $1$. Almost the same sentence as for the PMF. Make sure you understand the difference.\n",
